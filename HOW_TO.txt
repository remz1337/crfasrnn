DO NOT FOLLOW THE INSTALLATION FROM CRFASRNN REPO

1:
git clone --recursive <this repo>

2:
follow
https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Ubuntu-14.04-VirtualBox-VM

Some config are already in this repo, like Makefile.config

2.1:
When running make pycaffe, error about hdf5.h not found. To solve:
Edit Makefile (replace hdf5 with hdf5_serial, already done in this repo)
run this command:

find . -type f -exec sed -i -e 's^"hdf5.h"^"hdf5/serial/hdf5.h"^g' -e 's^"hdf5_hl.h"^"hdf5/serial/hdf5_hl.h"^g' '{}' \;
(from https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/2347)

2.2:
the test wont work,
python python/classify.py --print_results examples/images/cat.jpg foo
will throw an error. It doesnt matter, if you compiled successfully (make pycaffe, all, test)

3:
Run the demo

sh download_trained_model.sh
located in python-scripts

then modify crfasrnn_demo.py to use cpu only (gpu_device=-1,already done in this repo)
then run
python crfasrnn_demo.py
